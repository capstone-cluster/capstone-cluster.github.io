		We had our last meeting with Dr. Cotton on Tuesday and he seems very excited with our progress. The cluster sucessfully deployed on the C7000 with a slurm
		master and VMs with ESXi on each blade. There is much more about this on Adam's blog, but it would be fun in the future to take his project and
		switch from ESXi to Proxmox and then run his same tests to try and achieve better results. To get Proxmox working properly we had to use the REST API
		to handle the VMs and keep them a layer away from Proxmox. This adds a layer of complexity to the system and constraining the system like this may take
		away from some of the Proxmox features that make it excel when compared to ESXi. A main takeaway from this semester and our project as a whole is that
		there are so many ways to configure and launch a cluster. Each way has pros and cons and are very system specific. Now that everything is working on the
		C7000, the roots are there, I hope that Dr. Cotton and future students play with the configuration and deployment options to test and record results
		and find a maximum efficeincy setup.

		From what we have researched Proxmox is more efficient than ESXi, our team was interested in showing some results to back this up. Testing is no longer
		in the project scope because we do not have access to the 3 Dell towers (coronavirus) and the delay in receiving the C7000.
		People believe that Proxmox is taking over the market because it is open source, free to use, and more flexible. One of the biggest benefits is that Proxmox
		treats every node as a master node. This is why we tried to implement it in our project. Dan and I learned that although Proxmox has great reviews, there is 
		significantly more literature (especially related to older hardware) for ESXi. Although implementation prooved rather difficult, we eventually got the 
		script running to have Proxmox grab a master node and tell it to deploy a worker VM. While Adam and Theo continued with ESXi to complete the deliverables,
		Dan and I continued working on Proxmox to proove the theory and leave the project open for improvement. In the future, a team could implement Proxmox on the
		C7000 and R805 and run deployment testing to see if the clustering efficeincy has improved.

		Dr. Cotton set up the R805 on his home network and we are able to connect to it without the complications of the UD network. He told us that
		he will be setting up the C7000 and give us a zoom tutorial on how to access it next week.

		We got the terrible news that we will not be allowed back on campus for the remainder of the semester. We talked with Dr. Cotton about moving the R805
		off campus, and getting remote access to the C7000. He will get them when he goes to his office and set them up on his home network. We believe that 
		this will simplify our double VPN issue that we were having with pfSense and the UD network. Theo said he will be working on that this week.

		I did not do much this week due to an exam. More importantly, we found out that spring break was moved up to March 12th through March 29th because of coronavirus.
		We are not allowed on campus and expect to return online for the rest of the semester. This complication makes it difficult to continue learning as a team, I
		was really benefitting from sitting down with the team and working through problems together. We will now be meeting through video chat and working remotely. This
		should not significantly affect our deliverables, the servers are still running in Evans, so we can still work in VMs and VPN into the UD network to deploy on
		the servers. I am not sure what this means for the testing I was planning on doing to compare Proxmox and ESXi on one of the Dell towers if we are not allowed
		back on campus.

		Dan is trying to access files from the VM using Proxmox. We have some internet resources to help us through this but it is not working out as planned. I am
		going to continue working on this so that we can eventually let the master node create and set up the worker VM.

		We started to narrow down our goals for the rest of the semester. It was decided that we will be using Proxmox over ESXi
		several weeks ago, my goal will be to further justify this. Once we have more machines, I plan to run tests of them
		against eachother. In the coming weeks I will research how to test them against eachother as well as gathering more
		documentation information that goes over the differences in more detail.

		This was my first week back on the project after winter break. I spent winter working full time becuase my internship 
		was extended and did not do much on the project besides keeping up with my team members and trying to follow along 
		with documentation. We met with the TAs and Dr. Cotton, we are waiting on the C7000 machine so we can move off of VMs 
		and the R805.

		We are considering moving away from ESXi and using Proxmox instead. There is a lot of testing that
